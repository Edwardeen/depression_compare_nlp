Mental health challenges, particularly depression, are increasingly prevalent, and **AI-driven solutions** can help in early detection and intervention. As part of my journey in **Machine Learning & Data Science**, my team and I developed a **text-based depression detection model** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Supervised Learning Algorithms**.  

💡 **Key Objectives**  
🔹 Develop an **NLP-powered depression detection model** using social media text data.  
🔹 Compare the performance of **Random Forest** vs. **Naive Bayes** for classification accuracy.  
🔹 Highlight AI's potential in mental health screening to **enable early intervention**.  

### **🛠️ Technologies & Methods Used**  
✅ **Dataset:** Kaggle's *Suicide Watch* dataset (232,074 text samples).  
✅ **Data Preprocessing:**  
   🔹 Text sanitization (removal of noise, stopwords, and special characters).  
   🔹 Stemming & Tokenization for better feature extraction.  
✅ **Feature Engineering:** TF-IDF Vectorization to transform text into numerical form.  
✅ **Machine Learning Models:**  
   🔹 **Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)** – A probabilistic model for text classification.  
   🔹 **Random Forest Classifier** – An ensemble learning method for robust predictions.  
✅ **Model Evaluation:** Used **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**, and **confusion matrices** to compare results.  

### **📊 Key Findings**  
✅ **Random Forest outperformed Naive Bayes**, achieving a higher accuracy of **91.2% vs. 89.2%**.  
✅ **Random Forest demonstrated better recall & precision**, making it a more reliable model for detecting depressive text.  
✅ **Naive Bayes remains a strong baseline model**, performing well despite its simplicity.  

### **🌍 Real-World Impact**  
🔹 **Early depression detection** via AI can help **mental health professionals** and support networks intervene before a crisis escalates.  
🔹 This study proves that **machine learning & NLP** can be powerful tools in **mental health technology**.  
🔹 Future improvements could explore **deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers)** for even better accuracy.
